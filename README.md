# TemplateJs
TemplateJs is a minimal single-page web app template designed for quick deployment.
It follows an AI-assisted iterative development process:

- User stories and requirements drive feature development.
- Each iteration is a single commit for easy review.
- AI-assisted coding minimizes manual intervention.
- The focus is on defining clear requirements rather than manual coding.

This approach enables rapid prototyping and structured iteration.

## Using the Template
1.  **Fork and Open in CodeSpaces:** Fork this repository and open your fork using GitHub CodeSpaces.
2.  **Configure GitHub Pages:** Navigate to your repository's `Settings` -> `Pages`. In the "Branch" section, select the `main` branch to be automatically deployed by GitHub.
3.  **Access Your WebApp:** If your fork is `github.com/YourUserName/YourFork`, your WebApp will be live at `YourUserName.github.io/YourFork`.
4.  **Install Recommended VSCode Extensions (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   "**Live Server**": Renders the `index.html` page and provides live updates during development.
    *   "**GitHub Copilot**": Assists with coding tasks within CodeSpaces.
    *   "**Git Graph**": Helps visualize and manage Git branches.
5.  **Development Workflow:**
    *   Modify `index.html` for the main page structure.
    *   Add or edit JavaScript modules in the `src/` directory.
    *   Place static assets like images or JSON files in `src/assets/`.
    *   Create new HTML pages in the `pages/` directory if needed.
    *   Regularly commit and push your changes to the `main` branch to update your live application.

## Project Structure
This template uses a structured approach to organize files and facilitate development:

```
/
├── babel.config.js       # Babel configuration for JavaScript transpilation
├── index.html            # Main HTML entry point for the application
├── LICENSE               # Project license information
├── package.json          # NPM package configuration, scripts, and dependencies
├── README.md             # This file: project overview and instructions
├── pages/                # Contains additional static HTML pages
│   ├── about.html
│   └── features.html
└── src/                  # Main source code directory
    ├── index.js          # Primary JavaScript entry point, linked from index.html
    ├── index.test.js     # Tests for index.js
    ├── assets/           # For static assets like JSON data, images, etc.
    │   └── defaultData.json
    ├── components/       # Reusable UI components or JavaScript modules
    │   ├── person.js
    │   └── person.test.js
    └── utils/            # Utility functions and helpers
        ├── utils.js
        └── utils.test.js
```

### Best Practices:
*   **Modularity:** Keep JavaScript modules in `src/components/` or `src/utils/` focused on specific functionalities.
*   **Separation of Concerns:**
    *   `index.html` defines the structure.
    *   JavaScript in `src/` handles the logic.
    *   Static assets are stored in `src/assets/`.
    *   Additional distinct pages go into the `pages/` directory.
*   **Testing:** Write unit tests for your JavaScript modules (e.g., `*.test.js`). This template is set up for Jest, but you can adapt it.
*   **Dependencies:** Manage front-end dependencies using `package.json`.
*   **Babel:** `babel.config.js` is configured for modern JavaScript. You can extend it if needed.
*   **Clarity:** Ensure your file and folder names are descriptive.
